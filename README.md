# 🏥 Hospital Patient Waiting Time Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **patient waiting times in a hospital** to evaluate service efficiency and identify potential bottlenecks in the healthcare process.  
The study is based on **Statistics (Minor 1)** concepts and reflects a real-world healthcare scenario.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze patient waiting times across departments  
- Measure service efficiency using statistical methods  
- Identify departments with higher delays  
- Study variability in waiting times  

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains records related to patient visits and hospital services.

**Key attributes include:**
- `Patient_ID`
- `Department`
- `Arrival_Time`
- `Service_Start_Time`
- `Waiting_Time (minutes)`
- `Day`
- `Doctor_Availability`

> Waiting Time = Service Start Time − Arrival Time

---

## Statistical Concepts Used
- Mean and Median  
- Variance and Standard Deviation  
- Department-wise comparison  
- Outlier detection  

---

## Data Visualization (Add-ons)
- Box plots for department-wise waiting time distribution  
- Bar charts for average waiting times  
- Variance analysis graphs  
- Day-wise waiting time trends  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code  

---

## Analysis Performed
- Overall hospital waiting time analysis  
- Department-level efficiency comparison  
- Identification of peak waiting periods  
- Variability analysis using variance and standard deviation  

---

## Results & Insights
- Certain departments experience significantly higher waiting times  
- Doctor availability has a direct impact on service delay  
- Waiting times vary notably across different days  

---

## Future Enhancements
- Waiting time prediction using machine learning models  
- Interactive dashboard using Streamlit  
- Optimization of doctor scheduling  
- Priority-based patient management system  

---

## Difficulty Level
**Medium**

This project requires basic knowledge of **Statistics and Python** and is suitable for beginners in data analysis.
